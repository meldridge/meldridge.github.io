Good evening.

### Follow-up to Microsoft and the domain trust issues

>Of note, the MSRC staff I interacted with were amazing. However, the people in charge of the ultimate fix/won’t fix/v.Next decisions are the Microsoft teams responsible for the affected product(s). I understand why the responsible Microsoft team(s) didn’t want to fix this issue immediately. It’s a breakdown of a number of combined core “features” of Active Directory that, when strung together, produce the desired effect. “Fixing” this issue would not be easy and would likely break existing trust architectures.

>HOWEVER, as stated in the introduction, for years Microsoft stated that the forest is the security boundary in the Active Directory world, something we now know is not true. For years clients architected their Active Directory setups with the “forest is the security boundary” assumption- I myself have recommended to clients to build trusts between forests instead of within them because of the sidHistory attack. This is why we believe the issue discussed this in post is very, very bad.

### Security and boards asking questions

Good cyber security starts with boards that ask questions | afr.com

>There is no doubt boards of listed companies have a lot of information to assimilate and with the right mix of skills on the board and excellent external advisors, they are able to shape and guide on complex risks and strategy. Not every board member needs to be a lawyer to understand legal risk or an accountant to understand the annual audited accounts. But they do need to know enough to be able to understand when something isn't quite right.
