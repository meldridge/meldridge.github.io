title: Department of Health data de-anonymised
---

A short one today: yesterday two of the co-authors on my iVote paper, Drs Vanessa Teague and Chris Culnane, published a [paper](https://regmedia.co.uk/2017/12/17/report_on_deidentification.pdf) showing how they managed to identify individual people from an Australian healthcare dataset which was supposedly "anonymised".

[**No hack needed: Anonymisation beaten with a dash of SQL**](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2017/12/18/no_hack_needed_anonymisation_beaten_with_a_dash_of_sql/)

As the paper points out, the problem is that it's almost impossible to anonymise data effectively if it's published down to the individual level - when you have individualised data about a person, you can trivially cross-reference it to other information and re-identify the individual in question.

There's also an excellent [Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/jpwarren/status/942562275491160065) by Justin Warren which is well worth reading.
