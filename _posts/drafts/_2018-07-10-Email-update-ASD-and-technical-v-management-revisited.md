title: ASD as a statutory authority, technical v management revisited
---

Good morning.

### ASD becomes a statutory authority

As of last Tuesday, the Australian Signals Directorate is officially an independent statutory agency within Defence, one of the recommendations from the 2017 [Independent Intelligence Review](https://www.pmc.gov.au/national-security/2017-independent-intelligence-review). This means that ASD will now have a lot more freedom to manage its own pay scales, independent of the existing Australian Public Service salary bands.

From [iTnews](https://itnews.com.au/news/asd-chief-frets-over-cyber-recruits-496523):

>One potential option now more open to ASD than previously is restructuring how roles within the agency are designed outside the traditional defence and public service mould so they become more appealing to cyber talent, especially younger recruits.
>
>A known challenge both ASD and Defence have faced is a perception of limited mobility at less senior levels where people are often lured across to private sector jobs after substantial investment in training and security clearances.

It's a difficult problem, and ASD has tried to address it with special approvals to apply salary loadings for technical specialists above the standard APS pay brackets. 

Still, it's very difficult  to compete with industry when there's such a high demand for those same skills, and working in the private sector comes with other benefits which can't be matched by ASD: such as easier access to the internet and mobile devices, and the ability to talk about your work.

### Fixed pay brackets and technical specialists

We've talked about this issue in a [previous email](https://markeldo.com/Email-update-Tweetstorms-Technical-vs-management-and-blockchain-authentication/), and it remains a systemic problem in government IT recruitment:

>Conflating the technical and management streams also leads to significant problems in organisations where salary bands are highly structured and mapped to explicit position descriptions (quite common in government organisations). In this sort of model, earning over a certain amount—the _management threshold_—often means managing a team of employees, and little if any technical work.
>
>This causes all sorts of issues when the _management threshold_ is lower than the market rate for the specialists you need to keep the lights on. If you offer them market rate, they’re forced into management, and can no longer do the job they were hired to do. If you don’t offer them market rate, well… the results are predictable.

Anecdotally, I've heard many cases of talented technical people within ASD hitting a wall in terms of pay and seniority after only a few years in the job, and subsequently jumping ship to significantly better paid positions in the private sector. The result is that information security positions in Australian and U.S. companies are littered with ex-ASD personnel, and far too many of them end up heading overseas to positions in Silicon Valley.

This is a predictable outcome (and I can relate!), but one can also sympathise with ASD. Their hands have been tied by the rigid APS salary structures, and it's hard to match the private sector during a gold rush. Hopefully this new freedom will help them to stem the flow.
