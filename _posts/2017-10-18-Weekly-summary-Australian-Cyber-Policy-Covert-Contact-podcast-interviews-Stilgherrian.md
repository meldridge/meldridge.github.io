title: Australian Cyber Policy - Covert Contact podcast interviews Stilgherrian
---

A short email today (to compensate for the last couple of days): a plug for another podcast episode. 

This one is from the Covert Contact podcast by John Little at [Blogs of War](https://blogsofwar.com/covert-contact-the-blogs-of-war-national-security-podcast/). I only recently became aware of it and have only listened to a couple of episodes so far, but it's well worth subscribing to.

A recent episode interviewed our very own [Stilgherrian](https://twitter.com/stilgherrian), the same journalist who [broke the original story](http://www.zdnet.com/article/secret-f-35-p-8-c-130-data-stolen-in-australian-defence-contractor-hack/) regarding the hack on an Australian Defence contractor that we were discussing last week.

This episode was recorded before that news broke, so the focus is on Australian cyber policy generally, and Stilgherrian spends some time talking about DST Group in particular (with some admiration, which is nice). Well worth the time.
