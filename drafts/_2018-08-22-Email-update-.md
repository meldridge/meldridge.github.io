Good morning.

Yesterday's email had problems rendering correctly on certain clients, notably Outlook 2016. I'm still working on bedding down the template for these emails, so I apologise for the inconvenience. The full post can be found [here](https://markeldo.com/Security-is-always-a-trade-off/).

## Maersk and NotPeta

Wired has published [an excellent long-form piece](https://www.wired.com/story/notpetya-cyberattack-ukraine-russia-code-crashed-the-world/) on last year's NotPetya attack by Russia and how it wiped out the IT infrastructure of Maersk. The attack forced Maersk to rebuild almost their entire IT environment from scratch, including flying technicians to 

As Ned Pyle [pointed out](https://twitter.com/NerdPyle/status/1032740918917386240), one excerpt in particular "should be required reading for every C-suite and IT director on this planet".

>Snabe, however, didn’t say much about the company’s security posture pre-NotPetya. Maersk security staffers tell WIRED that some of the corporation’s servers were, up until the attack, still running Windows 2000—an operating system so old Microsoft no longer supported it. In 2016, one group of IT executives had pushed for a preemptive security redesign of Maersk’s entire global network. They called attention to Maersk’s less-than-perfect software patching, outdated operating systems, and above all insufficient network segmentation. That last vulnerability in particular, they warned, could allow malware with access to one part of the network to spread wildly beyond its initial foothold, exactly as NotPetya would the next year.

>The security revamp was green-lit and budgeted. But its success was never made a so-called key performance indicator for Maersk’s most senior IT overseers, so implementing it wouldn’t contribute to their bonuses. They never carried the security makeover forward.
