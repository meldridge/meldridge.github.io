Good morning.

Today's article is all about Blockchain. Some of you may be getting sick of this topic (I don't blame you!), so feel free to skip to the last story.

### Blockchain: hype meets reality

This piece by Kai Stinchcombe has been sitting in my list for a while. It's well worth reading in full, as it makes an excellent summary of all of the hype behind blockchain.

 [**Blockchain is not only crappy technology but a bad vision for the future**](https://medium.com/@kaistinchcombe/decentralized-and-trustless-crypto-paradise-is-actually-a-medieval-hellhole-c1ca122efdec):
 
>Blockchain systems are supposed to be more trustworthy, but in fact they are the least trustworthy systems in the world. Today, in less than a decade, three successive top bitcoin exchanges have been hacked, another is accused of insider trading, the demonstration-project DAO smart contract got drained, crypto price swings are ten times those of the world’s most mismanaged currencies, and bitcoin, the “killer app” of crypto transparency, is almost certainly artificially propped up by fake transactions involving billions of literally imaginary dollars.

>How exactly does blockchain stop this guy from spraying pesticides?
Blockchain systems do not magically make the data in them accurate or the people entering the data trustworthy, they merely enable you to audit whether it has been tampered with. A person who sprayed pesticides on a mango can still enter onto a blockchain system that the mangoes were organic. A corrupt government can create a blockchain system to count the votes and just allocate an extra million addresses to their cronies. An investment fund whose charter is written in software can still misallocate funds.

Exactly.

Not to mention the incredibly inefficient nature of blockchains. From a post by Tony Arcieri on the [The Cryptography and Cryptography Policy Mailing List](http://www.metzdowd.com/pipermail/cryptography/2018-February/033788.html/):

>To keep up with the state-of-the-art in Bitcoin mining today, and actually
mine at a hash rate where you stand a decent chance of producing winning
blocks at a semi-frequent rate, you are looking at building something like

>Where datacenters like that might inspire awe, the absolutely ridiculous
aspect of it is the actual useful work being accomplished by that
multi-silo datacenter facility and all of the miners around the world,
collectively, to the tune of 4 gigawatts of energy expenditure, could be
accomplished in a centralized system by a Raspberry Pi hooked to the
Internet by a 28.8kbps modem.

### Offensive Security now requiring webcam for OSCP exam attempts

A final quick story which will be of interest to some of you: Offensive Security is now requiring proctoring via webcam for all OSCP exam attempts, to combat an increase in cheating by people paying others to sit the exam for them. Apparently the going rate was around 500 USD, which is pretty cheap all things considered (the exam is 24-hours long). 

Unfortunately this was inevitable
