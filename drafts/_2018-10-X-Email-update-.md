Good morning.

Some follow-up to my Facebook post from earlier in the week: https://twitter.com/jpolakis/status/1046094369831485440

Also, in a [previous email](https://markeldo.com/Email-update-AMSI-for-macros-iPhone-PACs-reinventing-the-URL-and-infosec-resilience/) we discussed the use of authenticated pointers (PAC) in the latest iPhones, and how the technology is likely to make iOS exploit development significantly more difficult. Of course, no mitigation is perfect. Apparently a Chinese team has [already written an iOS 12 jailbreak](https://twitter.com/SparkZheng/status/1045265728318754816) which bypasses PAC.

When it comes to [persistence mechanisms](https://attack.mitre.org/wiki/Persistence), this is the gold standard - your implant will survive a reinstall of the OS and even complete replacement of the hard drive.
