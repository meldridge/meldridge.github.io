Good morning.

I'm back in Stockholm after a nice holiday in Norway, and its good to be back writing again. Quite a lot has happened since I left!

### My Health Record

This story has been major news in Australia for the last few weeks, ever since the [opt-out period started](https://www.computerworld.com.au/article/643821/my-health-record-opt-out-window-opens/) on July 16.

I'll avoid going into too much detail here, but to briefly summarise: the My Health Record system is a major Australian Government IT project which aims to consolidate every citizen's healthcare information into an electronic record which can be accessed by any healthcare provider they might use.

It's a great idea in principle, and many countries already have similar systems. In Sweden for example, all of my healthcare information is linked to my government-issued *personnummer*, which means I can pick up any prescription simply by showing my ID at the pharmacist. It's extremely convenient - no more printed scripts!
