Good morning.

I'm back in Stockholm after a nice holiday in Norway, and its good to be back writing again. Quite a lot has happened since I left!

### My Health Record

This story has been major news in Australia for the last few weeks, ever since the [opt-out period started](https://www.computerworld.com.au/article/643821/my-health-record-opt-out-window-opens/) on July 16.

I'm planning to write a proper blog post about this topic in the next couple of weeks, because it sits nicely at the intersection of many of the issues we've covered in [previous](/Email-update-Australian-Digital-Government-Report-and-myGovID/) [emails](/Email-update-CentrelinkFail-and-IBM-wins-billion-dollar-contract/) (not to mention my [Masterâ€™s thesis](/docs/Thesis-Final.pdf)): security, public trust, and the Australian government's history of failed IT projects.

in the meantime, [this article](https://www.canberratimes.com.au/politics/act/bungled-my-health-record-launch-represents-a-missed-opportunity-20180718-p4zs6z.html) is a good summary, as is [this interview](https://overcast.fm/+i39C_reY) with Paul Shetler, the former head of the Government's Digital Transformation Agency.
