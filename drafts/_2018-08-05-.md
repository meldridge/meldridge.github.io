Good morning.

I'm back in Stockholm after a nice holiday in Norway, and its good to be back writing again. Quite a lot has happened since I left!

Quick follow-up to the [last email](https://markeldo.com/Email-update-The-Mueller-Indictments-NPM-Arch-Gentoo-and-Ticketmaster-UK/): we covered the Ticketmaster UK hack where the attackers compromised an embedded JavaScript module to steal credit card details. [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kpl3BGYtY7g) goes into detail about how UK bank Monzo detected the compromise months beforehand, and warned Ticketmaster ([without success](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2018/06/28/ticketmaster_monzo_inbenta/)). It's interesting viewing.

### My Health Record

This story has been major news in Australia for the last few weeks, ever since the [opt-out period started](https://www.computerworld.com.au/article/643821/my-health-record-opt-out-window-opens/) on July 16.

I'll avoid going into too much detail here, but to briefly summarise: the My Health Record system is a major Australian Government IT project which aims to consolidate every citizen's healthcare information into an electronic record which can be accessed by any healthcare provider they might use.

I'm planning to write a proper blog post about this topic in the next couple of weeks, because it sits nicely at the intersection of many of the issues we've covered in [previous](/Email-update-Australian-Digital-Government-Report-and-myGovID/) [emails](/Email-update-CentrelinkFail-and-IBM-wins-billion-dollar-contract/) (not to mention my [Master’s thesis](/docs/Thesis-Final.pdf)): security, public trust, and the Australian government's history of failed IT projects.

In the meantime, [this article](https://www.canberratimes.com.au/politics/act/bungled-my-health-record-launch-represents-a-missed-opportunity-20180718-p4zs6z.html) is a good summary, as is [this interview](https://overcast.fm/+i39C_reY) with Paul Shetler, the former head of the Government's Digital Transformation Agency.

### Blockchain: hype meets reality

I had the chance to catch up on some reading while I was away, and this piece by Kai Stinchcombe has been sitting in my list for a while. It's well worth reading in full, as it makes an excellent summary of all of the hype behind blockchain.

 [**Blockchain is not only crappy technology but a bad vision for the future**](https://medium.com/@kaistinchcombe/decentralized-and-trustless-crypto-paradise-is-actually-a-medieval-hellhole-c1ca122efdec):
 
>Blockchain systems are supposed to be more trustworthy, but in fact they are the least trustworthy systems in the world. Today, in less than a decade, three successive top bitcoin exchanges have been hacked, another is accused of insider trading, the demonstration-project DAO smart contract got drained, crypto price swings are ten times those of the world’s most mismanaged currencies, and bitcoin, the “killer app” of crypto transparency, is almost certainly artificially propped up by fake transactions involving billions of literally imaginary dollars.

>How exactly does blockchain stop this guy from spraying pesticides?
Blockchain systems do not magically make the data in them accurate or the people entering the data trustworthy, they merely enable you to audit whether it has been tampered with. A person who sprayed pesticides on a mango can still enter onto a blockchain system that the mangoes were organic. A corrupt government can create a blockchain system to count the votes and just allocate an extra million addresses to their cronies. An investment fund whose charter is written in software can still misallocate funds.

Exactly.
