Good morning.

Some quick links before we get into the news. Bruce Schneier recently linked to a [report](https://csis-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/publication/180227_Cancian_CopingWithSurprise_wAppen_Web.pdf?0rD0fcMI7gGXNLM1AYJWoVsNT_xSxOiu) on future cyber warfare by Mark Cancian from the Centre for Strategic and International Studies. I'd recommend reading [this excerpt](https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2018/08/future_cyberwar.html) on Schneier's blog, it's compelling stuff.

If you're in the mood for reading security papers, Nick Sullivan from Cloudflare has posted [this Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/grittygrease/status/1028769194643353600), which links to some of the seminal works in the field of security and cryptography. It's an excellent list.

One of the major reasons for this move is because Microsoft has made such a vast improvement in detecting and blocking malicious PowerShell tools, including with the Antimalware Scripting Interface (AMSI) I discussed in my [last email](/Email-update-AMSI-for-macros-iPhone-PACs-reinventing-the-URL-and-infosec-resilience/).
