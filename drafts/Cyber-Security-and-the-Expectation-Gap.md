excerpt: Among the many things the security industry can learn from the auditing profession, how to deal with the expectation gap is one of them.

This story dropped a few days ago, and it's (sadly) unremarkable as far as security news goes: [Cabrini Hospital in Melbourne was hacked](https://www.theage.com.au/national/victoria/crime-syndicate-hacks-15-000-medical-files-at-cabrini-hospital-demands-ransom-20190220-p50z3c.html), a large number of medical files were ransomwared, the hospital made a payment to the attackers, but not all of the files were recovered.

This is becoming a common occurrence. There was of course the high-profile WannaCry attack and it's [impact](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/hospitals-across-britain-hit-by-ransomware-cyberattack/) on the UK National Health Service, but stories like this are popping up on a [regular](https://www.zdnet.com/article/us-hospital-pays-55000-to-ransomware-operators/) [basis](https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/two-us-hospitals-hit-with/).

To me, the interesting part about the Cabrini Hospital attack was the reporting. In particular, this paragraph:

>The latest hack is expected to fuel calls for the federal government to reinforce the nation's cyber defences, particularly email security.

This is what we call an *expectation gap*. 

### Financial Audit and the Expectation Gap

In financial auditing, the term [expectation gap](http://lexicon.ft.com/Term?term=audit-expectation-gap) is used to describe the difference between what the public *thinks* an auditor does, and what they *actually do*.




In short, the public thinks the government agencies like ASD can, and should, protect them from these sorts of attacks - after all, we have Defence to protect us against kinetic attacks - why can't they do the same for the cyber realm?

Of course, this is a ridiculous expectation. Defending a corporate network from hackers—even state-sponsored ones—isn't remotely equivalent to kinetic warfare. The only way ASD could stop this attack is to directly manage Cabrini Hospital's email service and network
