I am a software engineer and information security specialist with a background in penetration testing, software defined radio, and protected satellite communications. I've co-written a [paper](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-68687-5_8) on the security of online voting systems, and my [Master's thesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.02202) covered the same topic.
