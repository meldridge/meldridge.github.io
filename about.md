I am a software and cyber security engineer with a background in satellite communications and software defined radio networks. I've co-written a [paper](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-68687-5_8) on the security of online voting systems, and my [Master's thesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.02202) covered the same topic (direct link [here](/docs/Thesis-Final.pdf)).

### Newsletter

I author a newsletter containing information security news and analysis, with emails sent roughly fortnightly. Past emails can be found [here](/emails).
