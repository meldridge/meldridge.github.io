I am an information security specialist and software engineer with a background in penetration testing and military satellite communications. I've co-written a [paper](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-68687-5_8) on the security of online voting systems, and my [Master's thesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.02202) covered the same topic.

### Security mailing list

I operate a mailing list for security news summaries and analysis, with emails sent roughly weekly. If you'd like to sign up, you can [subscribe here](http://eepurl.com/dlZTVv).
